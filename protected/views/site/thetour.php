					Awarded with Trip Advisor's "Certificate of Excellence" on 2012, 2013 and 2014, this is a horseback riding tour designed for novice riders in which they will be guided to a slow ride through beautiful places in the jungle and fruit orchards, during which you may see monkeys, exotic birds, lizards and other species living in Bonanza. 
					<br>You will be taken to two fascinating cenotes (sinkholes), and you will be able to refresh and swim in one of them. Afterwards, you will be guided through a Zapote orchard (tree from which the bubblegum extract is taken), a trip into the history and origins of bubblegum; taste artisanal bubblegum, a delight that only the Mayan Kings could enjoy. 
					<br>The tour will end with non-alcoholic drinks and delicious snacks.
					<br>Due to personalized service, this is a special tour for up to 12 people.
